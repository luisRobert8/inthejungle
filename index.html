<!-- FAQ Section -->
<section id="faq">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Why should I care about AI search when I already rank on Google?</h3>
    <p>Google is already integrating AI into their search engine platform, this is done through AI Overviews and other AI technologies we don't see behind the scenes so their technology is changing and it's crucial that you keep up. When you search for something on Google you're no longer shown a website as the first result, you're shown an AI answer. Other technologies like ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, Claude and others are growing at rapid pace and a number of users are even saying they use them more than Google or have stopped using Google completely.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What kinds of businesses benefit most from this?</h3>
    <p>This is best for B2C businesses operating in a specific niche or have clear distictions compared to other businesses in the industry, due to the natural language processing of the AI models, users can be more specific about what they're searching for examples: "restaurants in a specific location that have large outdoor seating, vast vegetarian menu and free wifi", "A traveler looking for a pet friendly hotel in Paris within walking distance from the Eiffel Tower", "A shopper looking for a brown leather jacket under Â£200, available in a size M from a B corp" AI Search gives more power to businesses to really outline what makes them different from the rest and be more visible to target customer.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How is this different from traditional SEO?</h3>
    <p>I'll outline one difference, tradtional SEO relies largely on keywords to match what users are searching for, AI search uses intent, it's aim is to understand what the user is searching for and provide answers that best match the goal of the question not just linking the keywords to one another.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Whatâ€™s the process after I book a free audit?</h3>
    <p>1) You book. 2) We do an analysis of your website. 3) You get a tailored breakdown based on the analysis. 4) You will have the option to go further with a full consulation which includes a more in depth analysis of your website, an analysis of everything affecting your visibility and ranking, what AI knows about you, who it's suggesting you to and how its affecting your visibiliy, a strategic plan to improve what AI knows about your business and how to improve visibility.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How much does it cost if I decide to go ahead after the audit?</h3>
    <p>We offer a premium, tailored service at custom quoted rates starting at Â£1000 for small businesses. We also offer retainers for clients we have worked with that would benefit from ongoing monitoring and continous optimisation.</p>
